# SumoCoders FrameworkCoreBundle
This bundle is created and maintained by [SumoCoders](https://github.com/sumocoders). It contains a set of basic tools that enable us to build an application in a shorter timespan. The bundle is intended to be used together with our [npm package](https://github.com/sumocoders/FrameworkStylePackage).

## Installation
To properly use this bundle, create a new project with our application skeleton:
```
$ composer create-project sumocoders/application-skeleton my_project
```
The skeleton will load this bundle, install our npm package and add some extra config for CI, deployment, etc..
